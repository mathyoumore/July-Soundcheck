# #JulySoundcheck
## July Soundcheck is a collaborative effort to discover and review as much unfamiliar music as possible. The idea is simple:  
Every July, participants agree to review one album everyday for the entire month of July. But it's not enough to just review an album, it has to be album by an artist that the user has never heard of or never listened to.    

The album review has to be the size of a tweet. This was done to both make reviewing 31 albums in a month reasonable and to encourage users to critically think and analyze what they listened to. It's not easy to explain an entire album in 160 characters. Reviews also need to include a rating on a scale from 0 to 3+ (0, 1-, 1, 1+, 2- etc). Instead of being rated by the quality of an album, the rating is for how much the user *recommeds* the album. A 0 is an album to avoid. A 3+ means you should drop everything and listen to it. The idea is to decouple the quality of the music from how much a user enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Not everyone is a professional music critic, but we're all music recommenders.

At the end of the month, participants will have reviewed 31 albums they would have never listened to otherwise. They also get the benefit of every other participant's reviews. With just a handful of participants, every JulySoundcheck ends with hundreds of completed reviews. As of July 2015, over 300 albums have been reviewed. 

July Soundcheck takes you outside of your comfort zone and asks you to explore what music has to offer. Too often, we find a few artists that we like and stay in that little safe zone. July Soundcheck kicks you out of that safe zone for an entire month. The more people who participate, the more albums get reviewed, and the wider the world of music knowledge becomes for everyone.

The July Soundcheck website is for organizing this whole affair in a nice package. Artists, albums, and reviews are searchable and sortable. Users can register and review their albums when they finish them. This application is a lot more organized than the old system - a Google sheet document somewhere. The app will also encourage and allow people to write longer reviews after July to explain why they loved the albums they loved.
