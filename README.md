# July-Soundcheck
##July Soundcheck is a collaborative effort to discover new music and review as much music as possible. The idea is simple.
Every July, participants agree to review one album everyday for the entire month of July. But it's not enough to just review an album, it has to be album by an artist that the user has never heard of or never listened to. 
The album review has to be the size of a tweet. This was done to both make reviewing 31 albums in a month reasonable and to encourage users to critically think and analyze what they listened to. Reviews also need to include a rating on a scale from 0 to 3+ (0, 1-, 1, 1+ etc). Instead of being rated by the quality of an album, the rating is for how much the user *recommeds* the album. A 0 is an album to avoid. A 3+ is something to drop everything and listen. 
At the end of the month, participants will have reviewed 31 albums they would have never listened to otherwise. They also get the benefit of every other participant's reviews. With just a handful of participants, every JulySoundcheck ends with hundreds of completed reviews. 
The idea is to force yourself outside of your comfort zone and really explore what music has to offer. Too often, we find a few artists that we like and stay in that little safe zone. July Soundcheck kicks you out of that safe zone for an entire month. The more people who participate, the more albums get reviewed, and the wider the world of music knowledge becomes for everyone. 

The July Soundcheck website is for organizing this whole affair in a nice package. Artists, albums, and reviews are searchable and sortable. Users can register and review their albums when they finish them. This application is a lot more organized than the old system - a Google sheet document somewhere. The app will also encourage and allow people to write longer reviews after July to explain why they loved the albums they loved.
