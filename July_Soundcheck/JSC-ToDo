Issues

[ ] 1 Artist.best_album returns all of an artist's albums instead of their highest rated one
[ ] 2 Typeahead doesn't work well with other instances of itself. Wait or replace.
[X] 3 find_or_create album doesn't know what to do if an album with that same name exists
  - It needs to be able to know that the artists are dissimilar, so the albums are different
    - Example: UMO's, Makthavarskan's, Crystal Castle's "II"
  - Fixed by FOCB the review artist, then FOCB artist and album title
